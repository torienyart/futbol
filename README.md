[Turing School](https://turing.edu/) is an industry leading, online computer programming school, focused solely on helping students launch fulfilling careers in technology.

In week five of Mod 1 we are assigned a multiday group project named Futbol. Listed below are our specifications and outcomes of the project. 

## Learning Goals

* Build classes with single responsibilities.
* Write organized readable code.
* Use TDD as a design strategy.
* Design an Object Oriented Solution to a problem.
* Practice algorithmic thinking.
* Work in a group.
* Use Pull Requests to collaborate among multiple partners.

## About

We will be using data from a fictional soccer league to analyze team performance for specific seasons and across seasons. We want to see who the best and worst performers are, as well as be able to pull statistics for individual teams.

## Built With

Ruby 2.7.2 and RSpec 3.12 versions.

## Testing

A key goal of this project is to utilize Test Driven Development. Since the data set is so large, it was inefficient to use the actual dataset as our test data. Instead, we made up own test data by creating fixture CSV files.
